# ProtAgents
## Protein discovery via large language model multi-agent collaborations combining physics and machine learning

## Codes
This repository contains codes to solve complex problems in the context of protein design and analysis using multi-agent framework. The files named exp1, exp2, and exp3 in the repository, corresponding to the experiments I, II, and III, in the corresponding paper, respectively.   

## Use
The openAI API and Chroma keys are required to run the codes. The API keys must be provided in the "llm_config.py" file. Moreover, keys must be provided in the main files, exp1, exp2, and exp3. 

The model leverages a pre-trained autoregressive transformer model to predict the unfolding mechanical behavior of proteins. The path to the model must be provided in the file "agent_functions.py".
